Notes regarding program-evm
----------------------------------

1: There are one or more GEL files provided in this directory. The gels are specifically meant for 
   Program evm and not recommended to be use for other debugging purposes

2: The Program EVM  assume the CCS is installed in <CCS_INSTALL_DIR> (which is typically C:\Program Files\Texas Instruments\ccsv5 for Windows XP and ~/ti/ccsv5 for Linux)

3: Close CCS if open
